        <H2>Turning Gold into Lead</H2>
        In a startling breakthrough, scientist B.O. "Gus" Fizzics has invented a <STRONG>practical</STRONG> technique for transmutation! For more details, please see <A HREF="give-us-your-gold.html">our transmutation thesis</A>.
        <H2>Perpetual Inactivity Machine</H2>
        In a radical approach that turned traditional attempts to develop perpetual motion machines on their heads, Prof. Fizzics has developed a verified, bona fide perpetual inaction machine. To purchase your own for only $99.00 (plus $43.29 shipping and handling), please see our order form.
