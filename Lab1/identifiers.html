            <li>  <h3>Personal identification number</h3> 
                <p>A personal identification number (PIN), or sometimes redundantly a PIN number, is a numeric or alpha-numeric password used in the process of authenticating a user accessing a system. </p>
                <p>In common usage, PINs are used in ATM or POS transactions, secure access control (e.g. computer access, door access, car access), internet transactions or to log into a restricted website. </p>
            </li>
            <li> <h3>Full Date of Birth</h3>
                <p>Month, day and year</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Bank identification number</h3>
                <p>The Bank Identification Number, also called BIN, represents the first four to six digits on a credit card, which can be used to identify the issuing bank that issued the card. </p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Fingerprint</h3>
                <p>A fingerprint is an impression left by the friction ridges of a human finger</p>
                <p>Human fingerprints are detailed, nearly unique, difficult to alter, and durable over the life of an individual, making them suitable as long-term markers of human identity</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Password</h3>
                <p>A password, sometimes called a pass code, is a memorized secret, typically a string of characters, used to confirm the identity of a user</p>
                <p>In general, a password is an arbitrary string of characters including letters, digits, or other symbols. If the permissible characters are constrained to be numeric, the corresponding secret is sometimes called a personal identification number (PIN).</p>
